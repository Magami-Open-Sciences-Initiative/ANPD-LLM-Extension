# Project: LLM-Assisted Dataset Curation/Update of African Medicinal Plants Found in Nigeria 🇳🇬 and Africa

This project aims to use **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to significantly improve the curation and updating of a dataset on African medicinal plants specifically found in Nigeria and Africa. Existing datasets are often incomplete and inconsistent, with information scattered across various unstructured text formats like scientific literature and ethnobotanical records. The goal is to automate the extraction of relevant information to create a more accurate, extensive, and current resource for researchers, pharmacists, and traditional medicine practitioners.

## Executive Summary 📝

Nigeria/Africa has a vast diversity of medicinal plants crucial to traditional medicine and drug discovery. However, information about these plants (e.g., botanical details, traditional uses, chemical constituents, and regional names) is scattered and difficult to access. Manually curating this information is a time-consuming and error-prone process. This project will use LLMs to automate and streamline the extraction of this data from diverse textual sources, creating a centralized, well-curated, and regularly updated dataset.

## Methodology 🛠️

The project will be executed in several key stages:

### 1. Dataset Identification and Baseline Curation 📈

* Identify existing digital and analog datasets on Nigerian medicinal plants.
* Perform initial manual curation to establish a quality and completeness baseline.

### 2. Text Corpus Creation 📖

* Compile a large body of unstructured text, including scientific articles, books, dissertations, and online resources.
* This will involve techniques like web scraping and accessing institutional repositories.

### 3. LLM Fine-tuning/Prompt Engineering 🧠

* **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** and **Relation Extraction (RE)**: Using LLMs and frameworks like LangExtract to extract specific entities such as plant names (scientific, common, local), traditional uses, associated ailments, and chemical compounds and their relationships.
* **Information Normalization and Standardization**: Use LLMs to normalize data and address variations in naming conventions (e.g., synonyms for plants or ailments).

### 4. Human-in-the-Loop Validation 👨‍⚕️

* Implement a validation process where human experts review and correct information extracted by the LLMs.
* This feedback loop will be used to improve the LLM's performance iteratively.

### 5. Dataset Integration and Database Development 💻

* Integrate the curated and validated information into a structured database (ANPD) for easy querying and access.

## Expected Outcomes and Deliverables ✅

* A **significantly expanded and updated comprehensive dataset** of African medicinal plants in Nigeria, including botanical, ethnobotanical, chemical, and pharmacological information.
* An **LLM-assisted pipeline and associated tools** for efficient and continuous dataset curation.
* A **publicly accessible, well-structured database** of Nigerian medicinal plants.
* A **report detailing the methodology and LLM performance**.
* **Scientific publications** demonstrating the utility of LLMs in accelerating knowledge extraction for traditional medicine.
